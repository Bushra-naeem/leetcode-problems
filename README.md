## How to Solve Coding Problems?ü§î

Solving a coding problem involves several steps.
Here is a guide inspired by this [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-solve-coding-problems/).

1. **Understand the Problem**:

   - Read the problem statement carefully.
   - Identify the input and output requirements.
   - Clarify any ambiguities or constraints.

2. **Plan Your Approach**:

   - Think about possible solutions and choose the most efficient one.
   - Consider edge cases and how your solution will handle them.
   - Write pseudocode or a plan to outline your approach.

3. **Write the Code**:

   - Implement your solution in the chosen programming language.
   - Follow best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

4. **Test Your Solution**:

   - Run your code with different test cases to ensure it works correctly.
   - Test edge cases and validate the output against expected results.

5. **Optimize if Necessary**:

   - If your solution is not efficient, look for ways to optimize it.
   - Consider time and space complexity.

6. **Submit Your Solution**:
   - Once you are confident that your solution is correct, submit it.
   - Review feedback and make improvements if needed.

## Final Thoughtsüí¨

Practicing this problem-solving method will help you in your technical interviews and in your job as a developer.

If you don't feel confident when it comes to solving coding problems, just remember that problem-solving is a skill that anyone can get better at with time and practice.

Good luck!üíñ
